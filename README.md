# praywright_python_practice
Just a [Playwright Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/playwright-python) tool practice

## How to run
1. Run tests `execute_tests.sh`

## Notes:
I didn't enjoy this tool, cause it's very complicated. It totally looks like it just has been translated 
from JS Playwright and need to wright on Python usign JS style. So annoying. But this tools is pretty 
fast.
###
Anyway, I won't recommend this tool to young Python AQA engineers.
